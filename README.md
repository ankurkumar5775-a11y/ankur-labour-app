# 🧱 ANKUR – Labour & Contractor Connect App

ANKUR is a mobile-first web application designed to connect people who need construction or household labour directly with skilled workers and contractors across India — without job postings, bidding, or complex intermediaries.

The platform focuses on speed, trust, and simplicity, especially for blue-collar workers and Tier-2 / Tier-3 cities in India.
